**WELCOME TO THE UFO GAME**

**Description**

Oh no! Alien invaders have arrived and are abducting humans using tractor beams. It is up you to crack the codeword and earn your medal of honor by putting a stop to the abduction!

**System Requirements**

Things you need in order to play this game:

  * ruby 2.6.1
  * A command line interface / terminal

** Start the game **

In order to play this game navigate to the Codecademy folder and then in the command line type in

```ruby ufo.rb```

This command should get the game up and running. If at any point you wish to exit the program, you can always quit by pressing the control key and the C key at the same time. To restart the game after exiting type in the command above.

** Testing **

For unit testing I utilized the Ruby gem rspec. To ensure the tests are running correctly please enter the following commands into your terminal

```bundle exec rspec```

If that command does not work, navigate to the spec folder and type into the terminal:

```rspec ufo_spec.rb```

Have fun!
